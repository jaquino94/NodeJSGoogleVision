              Since the Google Cloud Vision library is readily available, where we just call a function to pass the image we want analyze. <br>
              There were only 3 things that we needed to do to create the entire program:
            </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Create the frontend for the user to be able to upload an image</li>
                  <li>Create the backend to invoke the Google Cloud Vision API and return the results to the user</li>
                  <li>A way to store the uploaded images to send to the Google Cloud Vision API</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Creating the frontend</h3>
            <p>
              The frontend was the most straight forward part of the exercise. We used Bootstrap to quickly create a form that
              will allow the user to upload the image they want to use. We also created the view as EJS as a way for us to
              pass the results we get from the Express server onto the interface.<br>
              We created a simple form action which is the following: <br>

            </p>

            <h3>Creating the backend and handling storage for uploaded images</h3>
              <p>
                  To start with the backend part, we followed the instructions on <a href=" https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/libraries#client-libraries-install-nodejs">Google Cloud documentation</a>
                  <li>Installed client library using command: npm install --save @google-cloud/vision</li><br>
                  <li>Created a new project on Google Cloud and enabled Cloud Vision API.</li>
              <img src="./images/enableAPI.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><p><br></p>
                  <li>Set up authentication by creating a service account key which creates and downloads a JSON file containing key</li>
                    <img src="./images/servicekey.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><p><br></p>
                  <li>Set up new environment variable with a value equal to the path of the service key.</li>
                    <img src="./images/envtvar.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><p><br></p>
              <li>For backend handling, we created the NodeTest.js file.</li>
              <li>It has an 'analyze' function that initializes the API client for sending requests to Cloud Vision API.</li>
              <li>Uploaded file is stored in bucket which returns a blob pointer using BlobStream writer.</li>
              <li>The API client is used to call labelDetection method which receives the uploaded image and returns a result array of labels. The labels are then passed to the rendered view page.</li>

              </p>

              <h3>Deployed application on gae</h3>
              <p>Created an app engine application and used command: gcloud app deploy
                  <img src="./images/gaedeploy.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br><br><br><br>
              </p>

              <h3>Screenshot of running application</h3>
              <p>Uploading image file
                  <img src="./images/app1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br><br>
                  Displaying labels for uploaded image
                  <img src="./images/app2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>
